### Full-Stack AI Engineer | Founder | Agentic AI Specialist

I am an **AI Engineer and Founder** with over 3 years of experience building, deploying, and scaling production-ready applications. I specialize in the intersection of **Generative AI, Agentic Workflows, and Scalable Cloud Infrastructure.**

I don't just build models; I build **intelligent systems** that take action, integrate with real-world APIs, and solve complex business logic.

 **Current Focus:** Scaling **Smartcord**, a multi-tenant AI platform automating lead generation via RAG and Agentic workflows.

### What I'm Building

I am currently obsessed with **"Action-Oriented AI"**—moving beyond simple chat boxes to agents that can manage entire business workflows autonomously.

**“I don't just build chatbots; I build the brains for modern business automation.”**
